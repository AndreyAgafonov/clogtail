simple and fast log tailer in pure c

first time it remembers file size as offset and produces no output

every next time it prints all data from last offset to the end of file

if file was rotated (recreated) it tries to search by specified glob for previous file and dumps it from last known offset to the end, then dumps new file.

Usage:

clogtail <filename> [glob]
