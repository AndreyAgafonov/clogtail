simple zero-copy and extremely fast log tailer in pure c

first time it remembers file size as offset and produces no output

every next time it prints all data from last offset to the last End-Of-Line

if file was rotated (recreated) it tries to search by specified glob for previous file and dumps it from last known offset to the end, then dumps new file.

usage:
    clogtail [options]

        -f <file>      path to file (required)
        -o <suffix>    offset file suffix (optional)
        -g <glob>      glob to use for searching for rotated file (optional)
